Comparison between LLx8 and HSx8

Delay:
	The time at which the voltage at the output node (VOUT) reaches 50% of its maximum value is commonly used to evaluate the delay of a gate. From the
	waveforms, observe the transition edges of VOUT and compare their timings across different loads. If the low leakage (LL) gate waveforms generally reach their
	midpoints later than the high speed (HS) gates, then the 
	gates have longer delay times.


Current:
	Look at the current waveforms (I(VDUMMY_C8), I(VDUMMY_GND8),
	I(VDUMMY_VDD8)) to analyze the current spikes during the switching
	activity. Higher current spikes might be indicative of faster switching
	but also greater power consumption and potential reliability concerns.
	If the LL gates show smaller current peaks than the HS gates, it suggests
	that LL gates consume less power during switching, which is expected as
	they are optimized for lower leakage and generally slower operations.



Comparison between LL and HS:

Delay:
	High Speed (HS) Gates Delay:
	The average propagation delay from netlist data is around 20.85 ps (2.0851E-11 seconds) for the lighter load
	(5.00E-17) and significantly longer under heavier load conditions.
	Low Leakage (LL) Gates Delay:
	The average propagation delay appears slightly longer, as shown in waveform. This typically happens due to the trade-off
	between speed and power consumption where low leakage gates are optimized for power efficiency at the
	cost of speed.
	
	delay in vdd is around=> 5%
	delay in GND is around=> 4%
	delay in C   is around=> 4% 



Current:
	HS Gates Current Peaks:
	Peak current values for HS gates are significantly higher, indicating more robust switching behavior but at the cost of higher power consumption and possibly more significant stress on 		the device.
	LL Gates Current Peaks:
	Lower peak currents for LL gates demonstrate their primary advantage: reduced power consumption which is crucial for power-sensitive applications

	current diffrence for GND => 16.14%
	current diffrence for VDD => 28.98%
	current diffrence for C   => 20.43%
		
	
Lower peak currents for LL gates demonstrate their primary advantage: reduced power consumption which is crucial for power-sensitive applications.
Disadvantages of LL Gates: Increased delay, which might affect the performance in speed-sensitive applications.
