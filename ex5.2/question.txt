Try to explain the different behavior of the currents when changing the load, and especially the different
contribution among Vdd current, Gnd current and Cload current in the various transition cases.

From the measures and the waveforms is possible to see that when the NAND gate is switching on/off (rising/falling edge of 
the output) the bigger the load capacitance, the higher the current peak. 
When input B has is rising the drop voltage across the PMOS transistor (for input B) is going to be HIGH, switching off it.
On the other hand the complementar transistor NMOS (for input B) is going to be switched ON. Therefore the NAND gate will experience
a positive GND current peak because the pull-down network is discharging the load capacitance. Even the Vdd current witness a peak that
is much more lower. This behavior is due to the fact that during the rising transition, at a certain point, both networks will be active,
when input B is Vdd/2 approximatelly. Thus both transistors are conducting. but the pull-up transistor (for input B) will drive current
for a very short periond before beeing switching off. 
From the output load capacitance it can be noticed that, the bigger the capacitance, the higher the current peak and the wider the 
current area (i.e more current is needed to charge complitely the load).
The same conclision are valide when in the opposite case.
