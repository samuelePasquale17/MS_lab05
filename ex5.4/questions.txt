What happens to the values of delay and power dissipation? Check the output measure and analyze
the advantages and disadvantages in using the two gates.

What can be noticed from the waveforms is that the nandHSX8MaxLoad gate is faster than the nandHScharMaxLoad, since the slope 
of the rising and falling edge of Vout is bigger. Thus the main advantage using the first gate are timing perdormaces. 
However, the side effect is that the current peaks are higher, with an increase in the power consumption as a consequence.
